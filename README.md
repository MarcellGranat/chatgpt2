## Installation

You can install the development version of {chatgpt} from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jcrodriguez1989/chatgpt) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jcrodriguez1989/chatgpt")
```

## Requirements

You need to setup your ChatGPT API key in R.

First you will need to obtain your ChatGPT API key. You can create an
API key by accessing [OpenAI API
page](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) -don’t miss their
article about [Best Practices for API Key
Safety](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety)-.

Then you have to assign your API key for usage in R, this can be done
just for the actual session, by doing:

``` r
Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "XX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
```

Or you can do it persistent (session-wide), by assigning it in your
`.Renviron` file. For it, execute `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, and in
that file write a line at the end your API key as

`r OPENAI_API_KEY=XX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
