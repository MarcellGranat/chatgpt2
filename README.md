## Installation

You can install the development version of {chatgpt} from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jcrodriguez1989/chatgpt) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jcrodriguez1989/chatgpt")
```

## Requirements

You need to setup your ChatGPT API key in R.

First you will need to obtain your ChatGPT API key. You can create an
API key by accessing [OpenAI API
page](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) -don’t miss their
article about [Best Practices for API Key
Safety](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety)-.

Then you have to assign your API key for usage in R, this can be done
just for the actual session, by doing:

``` r
Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "XX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
```

Or you can do it persistent (session-wide), by assigning it in your
`.Renviron` file. For it, execute `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, and in
that file write a line at the end your API key as

``` r
OPENAI_API_KEY=XX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Features

The {chatgpt} R package provides a set of features to assist in R
coding. Current existing addins:

- **Ask ChatGPT:** Opens an interactive chat session with ChatGPT
- **Comment selected code:** Comment the selected code
- **Create variable name:** Create a name for a variable that would be
  assigned the result of this code
- **Document code (in roxygen2 format):** Document a function
  definition, in roxygen2 format
- **Explain selected code:** Explain the selected code
- **Find issues in the selected code:** Find issues in the selected code
- **Optimize selected code:** Optimize the selected code
- **Refactor selected code:** Refactor the selected code

**Note:** When no code is selected, it will use the whole file’s code.

## Code Examples

#### `find_issues_in_code`

``` r
> cat(find_issues_in_code("i <- 0\nwhile (i < 0) {\n  i <- i - 1\n}"))

*** ChatGPT input:

Find issues or bugs in the following R code: "i <- 0
while (i < 0) {
  i <- i - 1
}"
1. The code is an infinite loop because i is always less than 0. The code should be changed to: "i <- 0
while (i > 0) {
  i <- i - 1
}"
```

#### `refactor_code`

``` r
> cat(refactor_code("i <- 10\nwhile (i > 0) {\n  i <- i - 1\n  print(i)\n}"))

*** ChatGPT input:

Refactor the following R code, returning valid R code: "i <- 10
while (i > 0) {
  i <- i - 1
  print(i)
}"
for (i in 10:1){
  print(i-1)
}
```

#### `create_variable_name`

``` r
> cat(create_variable_name("sapply(1:10, function(i) i ** 2)"))

*** ChatGPT input:

Give a good variable name to the result of the following R code: "sapply(1:10, function(i) i ** 2)"
squared_values
```

#### `comment_code`

``` r
> cat(comment_code("for (i in 1:10) {\n  print(i ** 2)\n}"))

*** ChatGPT input:

Add inline comments to the following R code: "for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i ** 2)
}"
# This code will loop through the values from 1 to 10, calculating and printing the square of each number.
for (i in 1:10) { # loop through values 1-10
  print(i ** 2) # print the square of each value of i
}
```

#### `document_code`

``` r
> cat(document_code("square_numbers <- function(numbers) numbers ** 2"))

*** ChatGPT input:

Document, in roxygen2 format, this R function: "square_numbers <- function(numbers) numbers ** 2"
#' Squares Numbers
#'
#' @param numbers numeric vector
#' @return numeric vector
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' square_numbers(1:4)
#'
square_numbers <- function(numbers) numbers ** 2
```

#### `optimize_code`

``` r
> cat(optimize_code("i <- 10\nwhile (i > 0) {\n  i <- i - 1\n  print(i)\n}"))

*** ChatGPT input:

Optimize the following R code: "i <- 10
while (i > 0) {
  i <- i - 1
  print(i)
}"
i <- 10
for (i in 10:1) {
  print(i)
}
```

#### `explain_code`

``` r
> cat(explain_code("for (i in 1:10) {\n  print(i ** 2)\n}"))

*** ChatGPT input:

Explain the following R code: "for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i ** 2)
}"
This code will print the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10. The for loop is created with the 'for' keyword, followed by a variable (in this case, 'i') and a range (in this case, from 1 to 10). The code within the loop will be executed for each value in the range. In this case, the code is printing the square of the variable i for each value in the range.
```
